# Anchor nRF52840 RTIC demo

This project contains a small example of integrating Anchor in an nRF52840 based
project. This example was tested on the nRF52840-DK development kit board, but should
work on other nRF52840 based boards too.

The project uses RTIC and shows one possible way of integrating Anchor in to such a project.
